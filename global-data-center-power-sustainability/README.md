## ✨ Key Analysis Objectives

This repository focuses on addressing critical questions about sustainable data center operations:

1.  **Efficiency Analysis:** Calculating and interpreting the **Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)** metric across various data center models and geographic locations.
2.  **Consumption Modeling:** Analyzing historical energy usage data using Python to identify trends, outliers, and project future energy demands.
3.  **Sustainability Impact:** Utilizing SQL to query and segment data for evaluating the correlation between operational metrics and broader sustainability goals (e.g., renewable energy adoption, carbon footprint reduction).
